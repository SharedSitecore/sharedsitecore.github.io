### The Evolution of the SharedSitecore Namespace
1. Everyone has used their own namespace or followed what [John West](https://sitecorejohn.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} made popular (and I too used for quite some time): **Sitecore.Shared**
2. In an effort to avoid Sitecore namespace conflicts, I moved to: **SitecoreShared**
3. Insert several other variations and versions of the namespaces
4. Now, I introduce, the best so far: **SharedSitecore**. This should provide greater discoverability (comes before Sitecore) and no namespace conflicts.
5. I am also following this naming convention everywhere now, such as: **SharedSelenium**
6. I am even working on a few projects worthy of the root level: **Shared**

With well over 1000+ various packages/projects spread out across Github, Azure DevOps and various systems, it will take a little while to get everything moved.
