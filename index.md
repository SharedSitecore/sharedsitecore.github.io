## Welcome to [SharedSitecore.com](/)

Bare with me. I'm just getting started moving to this collection/namespace/project/version. With well over 100+ various packages it will take a little while.

### The Evolution of the SharedSitecore Namespace
1. Everyone has used their own version, but [John West](https://sitecorejohn.wordpress.com/) made popular (and I too used for quite some time): **Sitecore.Shared**
2. In an effort to avoid Sitecore namespace conflicts, I moved to: **SitecoreShared**
3. Now, I introduce, the best so far: **SharedSitecore**. This should provide greater discoverability (comes before Sitecore) and no namespace conflicts.
4. I am also following this naming convention everywhere now, such as: **SharedSelenium**
5. I am even working on a few projects worthy of the root level: **Shared**

More details and resources coming soon. Stay tuned.

For now, watch Nuget for the latest releases: [https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=SharedSitecore](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=SharedSitecore).
